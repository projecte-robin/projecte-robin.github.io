      <description>On March 3rd, a group of IRI researchers visited SUARA premises to continue the working session initiated at IRI. This interdisciplinary working session tried to narrow down the details of the tasks selected in the first session, like getting objects from the ground and handling them (e.g. glasses, keys, etc) or providing reminders. Special attention was given to the three fundamental research pillars that sustain the project, trying to find out all the dialogue topics related to the tasks, identifying the situations that would require explainability and portraying the personalization features of the specific tasks to make them comfortable for the elderly.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday 17th, a group of professional caregivers from Suara visited the IRI laboratory to get to know the robots firsthand and be introduced to assistive robotics. During this visit, they were able to see the Tiago robot in action, navigating through the demonstrator flat or participating in cognitive games. After the visit, the Suara and IRI teams took part in an interdisciplinary working session to decide which tasks the robots could carry out to help the elderly and advance the three pillars of research that the ROB-IN project has as its flagship.</description>

      <title>Kick Off!</title>

      <description>On the 10th of December 2021, the kick-off meeting of the ROB-IN project took place at the premises of the Institute of Robotics and Industrial Informatics. Researchers from the different consortium members met to kick off the project and discuss the assistive tasks that the project robots were to perform during the pilots. The coordinators reviewed state of the art in assistive robotics over the last 15 years to assist in this exercise.</description>

      <description>The main objective in ROB-IN is to develop the enabling technology towards intelligent assistive robotics, and not to develop a final robotic solution at high TRL. Thus, the partners are experts in science and technology development (CSIC, UPC), data management and analysis (DATISION) and in care assessment (SUARA). Obviously, this is only a fraction of the value chain required to develop effective assistive robots, but at this point we still need to develop and validate some key enabling technologies.</description>
