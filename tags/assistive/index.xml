      <description>On the 10th of December 2021, the kick-off meeting of the ROB-IN project took place at the premises of the Institute of Robotics and Industrial Informatics. Researchers from the different consortium members met to kick off the project and discuss the assistive tasks that the project robots were to perform during the pilots. The coordinators reviewed state of the art in assistive robotics over the last 15 years to assist in this exercise.</description>
